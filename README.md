## 💡 Inspiration
We believe mental health awareness is essential for everyone. Many people face challenges silently, often without sharing them. Research consistently shows that journaling can alleviate mental stress by externalizing thoughts. Personal experience has shown us the impact that mental health can have on individuals, and we're committed to supporting those who may be struggling.

## 🕊️ Peace and Inclusion
Our project promotes peace and inclusion by providing a supportive, anonymous space that addresses social isolation and encourages open emotional expression. By creating a welcoming environment where users can share, connect, and receive support without fear of judgment, the platform fosters inclusivity and breaks down social barriers. Through positive interactions and shared experiences, it helps users feel connected and valued, creating a peaceful, inclusive community.

## 🤝 What it does
**PetPal** is an anonymous online platform designed to help users reflect on their emotions and connect with others in a supportive and uplifting environment. It allows users to:

**Express Their Feelings**: Share personal thoughts, emotions, and experiences through journal entries, which can be either private or public.

**View Posts**: Users can browse content that resonates with their own feelings, fostering a sense of connection and understanding.

**Earn Points**: Users earn points by posting entries or commenting uplifting messages, which help level up their companion pet, adopt more pets, and gain accessories. These points encourage meaningful contributions, fostering a compassionate community where users inspire and uplift one another.

## ⛏️ How we built it
Our application’s backend is primarily built with **Firebase**, **Javascript**, **Express.js**, and **Axios**, while the front-end utilizes **React**, **Figma**, and **Mantine** for a seamless user experience. Additionally, we integrated the **Gemini API** to assign tags, personalizing the user's For You page based on their preferences.

## ⭐ What's next for PetPals
In the future, **PetPal** will introduce Pet Farm, a global feature where users can visit and gift each other’s pets, fostering community and kindness. We’ll also launch a **Google Extension**, allowing users to interact with their pets outside the website, keeping them engaged and connected across the browser. These features aim to enhance global interaction and support mental health through constant, positive engagement.
